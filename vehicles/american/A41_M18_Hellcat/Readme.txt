P.A.C.T. project presents:
Requested by Dante5521, Twilight Sparkle on M18 Hellcat.

Just Drop it in \res_mods\0.7.4(or whatever version of game it will be)\vehicles\american\A41_M18_Hellcat.

In alternative stuff folder:
1) Dismantled MG on stock turret, so you can see Twi from behind.
2) Extra-Extra-Sad-Twi™ for crashmodel, both turrets. Darn can't see her being sad. If i only had something that motivating to play awesome before - my surviving rate on M18 would be more than 146%.
You can delete alternative stuff folder, if you want, there's nothing necessary in it anyway. 
Have fun.

Ну вы ПОНИли, что в альтернативной фигне - убранный пулемёт сток башни и чертовски грустная Твай для краш модельки.
